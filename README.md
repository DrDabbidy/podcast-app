# CSC207 Course Project: Show Notes

An podcast transcription application made in Java following the Clean Architecture.

## Project Overview
When using a music platform like Spotify or Apple Music, several useful features are included: lyrics that are synced in real time to the song, the ability to search songs by lyric, and more. However, it is rare to see podcasts get the same type of love. With Show Notes, we wanted to change that.

Show Notes aims to supercharge podcasts using AI. Users upload podcast audio files, and are then able to access a full transcript of the podcast, listen to podcast, generate a summary, and use the natural language search feature to search through their podcasts based on the contents of their transcripts. 
## Environment Setup
Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`, and fill in the appropriate API keys and values.
## Functionality Demonstration
Here is a short demo of showing a user creating a podcast, uploading an episode, and playing it.
